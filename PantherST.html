   <p>
  This is our Steiger Panther III ST 325. It was recently painted up, and it turned
  out really well. That polyurethane paint sure makes it shine. It’s one of those
  tractors that feels like it was built to work all day. We’re thankful to have it
  in the lineup, and we enjoy sharing it because there’s always something new to
  learn about these older machines.
