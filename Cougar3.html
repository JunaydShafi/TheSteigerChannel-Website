  This is our Steiger Cougar III PT 280. It was originally a Bearcat III that was used
  heavily in laser scraping applications, but it was later repowered with a Cummins M11
  when it was sold to a dealership and had a lot of work done to it. It now has a new
  transfer box and transmission, and the engine is brand new as well. It’s a good,
  honest tractor that gets the job done without a lot of fuss. We enjoy running it and
  learning what it’s best at. It’s another example of why these machines still have a
  place on the farm today.
