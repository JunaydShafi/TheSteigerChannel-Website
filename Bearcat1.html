    <p>
  This is our Steiger Bearcat I that has been painted up to resemble a Series II.
  It has been repowered with a Caterpillar 3208 engine and a turbo, bringing it
  to around 250 horsepower. The tractor is currently running 23.1×34 tires and
  has proven to be a solid, reliable machine for us.
  Overall, it’s a great tractor that has treated us well and hasn’t given us any
  major issues.
